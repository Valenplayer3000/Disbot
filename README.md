# Disbot

A new, simple discord self-made using python.

100% Open Source code ðŸ‘Œ

For fun purposes only.

## âš  Please Read the Future of Discord.py!
For actual reason the discord.py repository is now read-only and archived. I'm looking forward to use javascript or other languages to maintain the bot.
